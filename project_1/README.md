## Abstract

## Objectives
Learn to use a library for creation, manipulation and analysis of graphs. Learn
and implement metrics and models of graphs. Analyze graphs by some of the
implemented metrics.

## What we did
To reach our goals we proposed to create a library of algorithms over graphs on
top of the boost graph library for C++.
We implemented the metrics
*average path length*,
*degree distribution*,
*closeness centrality*,
*clustering coefficient* and
*betweeness centrality*.
Apart from that, we also implemented algorithms for the instantiation of graphs
following the Erdős-Renyi, Watz-Strogatz and Barabási-Albert models.

## Analysis
Apart from the creation of the library, we also made some graph analysis
applying the metrics and models we implemented.

### Betweeness centrality
We made an analysis of the *betweeness centrality* of vertices on random and
scale-free graphs. For that we created 20 graphs with 1000 vertices for each
model and measured the average *betweeness centrality* for each degree averaged
over all graphs. For the random graphs, the probabilities used were 0, 0.05,
0.1, and so on, upto 1.

### Clustering coefficient

## Results
